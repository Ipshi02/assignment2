In particular, we can create visualizations that depict the diversity of races in various states. This large pool of data can also be turned into visualizations that can help us understand significant numbers, and what they may imply. Census data is also critical overall for the U.S. aOne specific example, Black individuals tend to be overrepresented for their contribution to the crime rate in America, because their smaller population is not factored in. Similarly, White people are underrepresented for their crimes because they make up the majority of the population. Additionally, it helps determine how federal funds are distributed to people, which is critical. These stats can give important insight into the overall distribution of races, and how diverse our society really is. If the data quality is off, it can misrepresent the entire population. Certain groups of races can be excluded which is misleading.\n",
